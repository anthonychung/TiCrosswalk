# Titanium Crosswalk Module

# No longer maintaned
Since we no longer use Titanium this module is sadly no longer maintaned by us. If you want to take over maintanence please send an email to david@universalavenue.com and we can figure it out.

## Description

A cross platform web view extension/replacement for Titanium Mobile that uses the fantastic 
[Crosswalk WebView](https://crosswalk-project.org/) on Android and extends the standard 
Titanium iOS WebView API to match.

## Usage

##### Using the module in a Alloy-view

```xml
<WebView id="webView" platform="ios" />
<WebView id="webView" platform="android" module="com.universalavenue.ticrosswalk" />
```

##### Creating a webView directly

```js
function createWebView (props) {
  if (OS_ANDROID) {
    var xwalk = require('com.universalavenue.ticrosswalk');
    return xwalk.createWebView(props);
  }
  return Ti.UI.createWebView(props);
}

var win = Ti.UI.createWindow(),
    webView = createWebView({ url: 'https://universalavenue.com' });
win.add(webView);
win.open();
```

##### Evaluating JS

Use the `evalAsync(code, [callback])` method to evaluate JS inside the WebView without blocking the main thread. This is a major speed boost, especially on Android.

```js
var code = '(function(arg){ return { some: "object", arg: arg }; })(["<your args>"])';
webView.evalAsync(code, function (res) {
  var obj = res && JSON.parse(res);
});
```

The iOS version of this module simply extends the existing Titanium WebView, meaning you can use the same APIs as on Android.

**Note:** The behavior of evalAsync differ a bit between platforms. In order for things to work cross platform you need to wrap your call in an IIFE (like above) and make sure to skip the final semicolon! 

See [issue #6](https://github.com/UniversalAvenue/TiCrosswalk/issues/6) for details.

# New Additions 
- Date: 20171117

## Android Alert Dialog support
- implemented Crosswalk support for Alert dialogs in WebViewUIClient.java.

## Android Override back key behaviour
- Crosswalk will by default navigate back through navigation history when the Android back button is clicked.
- To override this behaviour and finish the Crosswalk activity when back is clicked, set the following setting.

```
webView.setOverrideBackKey(true);
```
